- can only place boxes on shelves?

- DEATH STRANDING:
	- speed-based distance - increased range/speed = you get to deliver to more places
	- tsp solving?
	- more stuff = more unstable (in bl, slower? more noticable/noise generating)
	- delivering to distance post = unlocks farther deliveries

- SLENDERMAN
- ROGUELITE
- BLOCKLAND
	- Building structures/Placeable camps?
	- Multi-run-based approach, prepping the route to be run?

finalized design elements:
- open world, with sparsely generated structures
- pve-focus, since package delivery sim isn't inherently interesting enough
	- pve-focus still allows package-structure-buliding as a mechanic
- destinations request packages, which are provided at delivery locations
- biomes centered on the destination
- package weight affects sprint only

equipment:
- clipboard - record the contents of a notice
